Approach

I'll teach you each problem by:

    Explaining the problem intuitively.

    Breaking down the thought process behind the solution.

    Walking you through clean, well-commented Python code.

    Explaining time and space complexity.

Suggested Order to Learn (Progression of Difficulty):

###  Start with Arrays and Stacks. These improve fundamentals:

    Insert Interval

    3Sum

    Product of Array Except Self

    Combination Sum

    Merge Intervals

    Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

    Min Stack

    Trapping Rain Water

###  Move to Binary Trees and Graphs. These teach recursion and BFS/DFS:

    Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

    Lowest Common Ancestor

    Serialize/Deserialize Binary Tree

    Clone Graph

    Number of Islands

    01 Matrix

    Course Schedule

    Rotting Oranges

###  Next is Strings and Binary Search. Learn sliding window and search:

    Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

    Minimum Window Substring

    Search in Rotated Sorted Array

    Time-Based Key-Value Store

###  Then Dynamic Programming:

    Maximum Subarray

    Coin Change

###  Finally Heap and Recursion:

    K Closest Points to Origin

    Find Median from Data Stream
